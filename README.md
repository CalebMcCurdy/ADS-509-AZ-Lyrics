# Assignment 1: Data Acquisition with APIs and Scraping

Acquiring data is one of the fundamental steps in any analysis and proficiency at APIs and web scraping unlocks rich data sets for future analyses. In this assignment, you will scrape lyrics from AZlyrics.com.  

Instructions: 

1. Create a repository under your GitHub account from this template: [https://github.com/37chandler/ads-tm-scrape](https://github.com/37chandler/ads-tm-scrape). Instructions can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template). Make your repository public or add your instructor’s Github account as a [collaborator](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository). 
2. Choose two musical artists for your project. Both should have at least twenty songs at their artist page on AZLyrics. Those pages have forms like this: https://www.azlyrics.com/r/robyn.html. 
3. The file “Lyrics Scrape.ipynb” holds your starting code for this assignment. 
    * This file holds starting code for the assignment. Follow the instructions in that notebook, pulling and storing the lyrics for both artists.
    * The final part of the notebook holds the evaluation code. If you’ve completed the assignment correctly, you should be able to just run this section as is. 

**Things to leave out of your repo**
1. Do not include the raw data in the repository. The `.gitignore` file is set up to ignore the `lyrics/` folder. Git attempts to track every character change in every committed file, so committing a large data file and then making any modification to it can result in a repository that is large and hard to work with. 

Assignment Materials:
* [Web Scraping Repository](https://github.com/37chandler/ads-tm-scrape)

Deliverables:
* When you have finished your code, print your notebook as PDFs and upload these documents to Canvas. 
* Commit your code and push the changes to GitHub so your instructor has access to the ipynb notebook files and any other code you create.

# Assignment 2: Tokenization, Normalization, and Descriptive Statistics

This assignment gives you the opportunity to practice the techniques of this module: tokenization, normalization, and calculating descriptive statistics. You will practice these skills here, then use them in every subsequent assignment. 

Instructions: 

1. Create a repository under your GitHub account from this template: [https://github.com/37chandler/ads-tm-token-norm](https://github.com/37chandler/ads-tm-token-norm). Instructions can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template). Make your repository public or add your instructor’s Github account as a [collaborator](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository). 
2. If you did not complete the assignment for Module 1, download “M1 Assignment Data.zip” from Canvas and extract it into your repository. This folder includes not only what you did in the last module, but also information about the followers of the singers on Twitter.  
3. The “Lyrics and Description EDA.ipynb” file within the repository holds the starting code and instructions for the assignment. 
4. Work through the notebook, performing the steps asked of you. Use and extend the code from the chapters of your textbook. 
5. Part of the data in the folder named Twitter is obtained using Twitter API. 

Assignment Materials:
* [Tokenization, Normalization, and Descriptive Statistics Repository](https://github.com/37chandler/ads-tm-token-norm)
* M1 Assignment Data.zip


Deliverables:
* When you have finished your code, print both of your notebooks as PDFs and upload these documents to Canvas. 
* Commit your code and push the changes to GitHub so your instructor has access to the ipynb notebook files and any other code you create.
