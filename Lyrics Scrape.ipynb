    "The lyrics site, www.azlyrics.com, does not have an explicit maximum on number of requests in any one time, but in our testing it appears that too many requests in too short a time will cause the site to stop returning lyrics pages. (Entertainingly, the page that gets returned seems to only have the song title to [a Tom Jones song](https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/tomjones/itsnotunusual.html).) \n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever you call `requests.get` to retrieve a page, put a `time.sleep(5 + 10*random.random())` on the next line. This will help you not to get blocked. If you _do_ get blocked, which you can identify if the returned pages are not correct, just request a lyrics page through your browser. You'll be asked to perform a CAPTCHA and then your requests should start working again. \n",
